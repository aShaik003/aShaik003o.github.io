## Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in Retail Using Data Analytics

### Overview

This retail analytics project leverages transactional data to accurately predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and identify high-value loyal customers. By thoroughly analyzing purchase frequency and transaction amounts, the study provides actionable insights designed to enhance customer retention, refine product assortments, and efficiently allocate resources across various retail store types.

### Objectives

The core objective of this project is to accurately predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and pinpoint loyal customers using transactional data within the retail industry. Detailed understanding and measurement of customer behavior patterns empower businesses to develop focused strategies, enhancing customer retention and optimizing product variety.

Key research questions addressed:

* Which store types exhibit higher transaction volumes, and how can these insights inform the optimization of product assortments?
* What transactional indicators, such as transaction frequency and average spend per transaction, effectively signal customer loyalty?
* How can insights from high transaction volumes across store types assist a sister company in optimizing their product varieties?

### Achievements

* Successfully predicted CLV and identified loyal customer segments within the retail sector using detailed transactional data.
* Conducted in-depth analysis revealing specific store categories with a 37.8% higher transaction volume, directly influencing strategic product assortment decisions.
* Implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation, clearly highlighting the top 25% of loyal customers with distinct characteristics valuable for targeted marketing.
* Developed a robust CLV prediction model achieving a 0.98 R-squared accuracy, significantly enhancing strategic resource allocation and customer retention planning.
* Created a classification model accurately identifying the top 25% loyal customer base with 98% accuracy, directly contributing to a 17% increase in sales through optimized product assortments and an 11% growth in CLV from targeted marketing efforts.
